Exile Element - Hide any element with one key, undo with another (Chrome extension)


Built because I couldn't find a single extension that did this one simple thing without bloat.

Exile Element lets you hide any element on any webpage. Hover over the thing, press Ctrl+Shift+X, and it’s gone — hidden with display: none. Need it back? Hit Alt+Z to undo. That’s it.

No right-click menus. No weird UI. No “pro” features. Just a hotkey and some peace.
(Want different keys? Head to chrome://extensions/shortcuts to customize them.)

What it does:

    🔹 Hide anything on the page that you hover with a single key
    🔹 Undo your last hide with another key
    🔹 Works everywhere, instantly
    🔹 No data collection, no accounts, no fluff
    🔹 Built for devs, power users, and people who hate popups
    🔹 Open source, forever free
